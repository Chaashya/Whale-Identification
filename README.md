# Whale-Identification

According to Ocean.org, "Humpback whales are identified by the underside and trailing edge of their tail flukes; each one is different just like a fingerprint" and so, with this project, the aim is to identify individual whales in images. The data used for this project is from HappyWhale, which is a platform that allows users to submit a whale photo and have it automatically identified using image process algorithms.
